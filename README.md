10/26 - I'm having issues with making the website responsive, I don't fully understand how to make it work.

10/28 - So far so good, still having to iron out some problems but I can always ask during class about elements and their sizes. Responsive design is easier after having read through a few lines of tutorials.

11/12 - And it all comes crushing down, I can't fix it at all. How in the Hell is anything logic?

11/19 - It's frustrating to even try changing anything as the vision of the website gets worse and worse. I'm just frustrated with it. I don't believe I can continue until the issue has been fixed.
