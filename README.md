10/26 - I'm having issues with making the website responsive, I don't fully understand how to make it work.

10/28 - So far so good, still having to iron out some problems but I can always ask during class about elements and their sizes. Responsive design is easier after having read through a few lines of tutorials.

11/12 - And it all comes crushing down, I can't fix it at all. How in the Hell is anything logic?

11/19 - It's frustrating to even try changing anything as the vision of the website gets worse and worse. I'm just frustrated with it. I don't believe I can continue until the issue has been fixed. It just gives me anxiety.

11/25 - Just needed a short break to continue with this. It worked splendidly!

12/11 - I have accomplished everything on the checklist and there is not much that needs to be added, if at all.

# Project Summary

> Remember that before the final submission date you should include a "PROJECT SUMMARY" in this section here.

This project has involved myself making a website surrounding a certain theme with a limited number of colors. It contains three pages for a fictional restaurant situated in Boston/Brooklyn (I realised I've picked Boston for the front page and Brooklyn for the iframe map). We have a homepage containting a bit of information with some images that visualize the feel of what the restaurnt is trying to invoke. An information page describing the business, where you can find it with the help of Google maps and an image containting a menu with some products that we offer. Lastly, we have a page where you can contact us through e-mail with any queries that you may have. The website has been made with accessibility in mind, we have added buttons that will read text using text-to-speech for anyone that may have dyslexia or problems with their vision. Any button that you hover over in the sidebar will also say out loud which page it will lead to.

Making the website was a pretty fun experience in which I have learned quite a lot for a first timer in this subject. There have been some issues like elements not being displayed correctly and frustrations with the way responsive design was implemented. These issues were fixed after browsing the internet on websites like W3Schools and MDN for tips. I really feel like it has been interesting regarding every point in this course, even if it at times have been maybe a bit much to comprehend.

If I would improve on things on the website it would for sure be the way everything is displayed. To me it is a bit bland looking and it looks very basic when it comes to layout. It would be interesting to add more features to further increase accessibility. For example, the sidebar buttons and their sounds do not work on phones and devices which rely on touch screens because the code relies on the onmouseover property in javascript. I would also like to add ways for blind people to access the website, like pressing spacebar (since it is very distinguishable on the keyboard) and it reads out everything on the page. Even adding keyboards shortcuts like Z to home, C to information and V to Contact us.

Last but not least, the budget. It seems I have gotten pretty close when it comes to scheduling the times for each section. Clocking in at around 22 hours and 30 minutes there was however less time spent on the project than the 30 hours which should have been utilized. Sticking to a schedule is not something I am so good at as I often come up with new details to add to previously finished sections. There were also problems I found that would result in me needing to change each page of the website. In short, a lot of micromanagement.

All in all, I think that the things I have learned in this course is sufficient enough for a beginner like myself and it has built a good foundation in case I wanna delve deeper in the future.
